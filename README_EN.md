## OpenSteamTool Core Capabilities

OpenSteamTool is a C++ engine that injects into the Steam client via DLL. This tool provides a graphical interface for it. Once injected, you gain:

| Capability               | Description                                                                    |

| **Depot Decryption**     | Auto-inject depot decryption keys for normal file downloads                    |
| **Manifest Download**    | Auto-download depot manifests with version locking to prevent unwanted updates |
| **Access Token**         | Support for protected games/DLCs that require access tokens                    |
| **Stats & Achievements** | Enable Steam stats and achievements for unowned games                          |

## Dashboard Overview

Automatically detects Steam installation status, injection status, and library overview on startup:

## Usage Guide

### Step 1: Inject into Steam

1. Go to the **Injection Manager** page
2. Click the **Inject Steam** button
3. Restart the Steam client to take effect

> If Steam is currently running, the app will prompt you to close it first.

### Step 2: Search and Add Games

1. Go to the **Search & Add** page
2. Enter a game **AppID** (e.g., `730` = CS2) or **English game name**
3. Click **Add to Library** — the tool automatically fetches metadata, DLC lists, and decryption keys, then generates the config

![Search & Add](assets/2026-06-03-13-38-55-image.png)

### Step 3: Manage Your Game Library

1. Go to the **Game Library** page to view all added games
2. Sort by name/AppID or search to filter
3. Right-click a game card to: copy AppID, copy game name, view on Steam, or remove from library

## In-Library Result

Once added, the game appears directly in your Steam library:

## Antivirus Notice

If Windows Security flags the program as a threat (DLL injection may trigger false positives), follow these steps:

1. Open **Windows Security**

![Windows Security](assets/2026-06-03-14-16-28-image.png)

2. Go to **Virus & threat protection** → **Manage settings**

![Manage Settings](assets/2026-06-03-14-27-30-image.png)

3. Turn off **Real-time protection**. Windows Security is prone to false positives with DLL injection tools — disabling it prevents the program from being blocked.

## FAQ

### Steam shows no change after injection?

Make sure you have **restarted Steam**. DLL injection only takes effect at Steam startup. Use the **Verify Injection** button on the Injection Manager page to check the status.

### Game shows "Content still encrypted" after adding?

This occurs when some Depots are missing decryption keys. The tool automatically fetches them — if the issue persists, check your network connection.

### How do I uninstall the injection?

Click **Remove Injection** on the Injection Manager page, then restart Steam. You can also manually delete the three DLL files from your Steam root directory.

## Developer Guide

This is an open-source project — contributions and debugging are welcome. Follow the steps below to set up a local development environment.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| OS | Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit) |
| Python | **3.10+** (3.12 or 3.13 recommended) |
| Steam Client | Installed and logged in |
| Git | Any version |

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yong0512/OpenSteamToolDesktop.git
cd OpenSteamToolDesktop
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create .venv in the project root
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

> The command prompt prefix will show `(.venv)` once activated.

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key dependencies:

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `PyQt6` | GUI framework |
| `PyQt6-Fluent-Widgets` | Windows 11 Fluent Design component library |
| `httpx` | HTTP client (API requests, cover downloads) |
| `requests` | Fallback HTTP client |
| `pytest` | Unit testing |

### 4. Run & Debug

```bash
# Launch the app
python main.py
```

On startup, the app automatically:
- Detects the Steam installation path (via registry)
- Checks and downloads the required DLL (if missing)
- Checks for app updates
- Loads the game library

**Debugging tips:**

- Logs: `~/.OpenSteamToolDesktop/logs/main.log`
- Config: `~/.OpenSteamToolDesktop/config.json`
- DLL cache: `~/.OpenSteamToolDesktop/DLL/`
- Lua configs: `~/.OpenSteamToolDesktop/config/lua/`

### 5. IDE Debugging

<details>
<summary><b>VS Code</b></summary>

1. Install the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
2. Open the project root folder
3. Select interpreter: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Python: Select Interpreter` → choose the `.venv` Python
4. Press `F5` to debug, or add this to `launch.json`:

```json
{
    "name": "OpenSteamToolDesktop",
    "type": "python",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/main.py",
    "console": "integratedTerminal",
    "justMyCode": false
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>PyCharm</b></summary>

1. `File → Open` the project root directory
2. `File → Settings → Project → Python Interpreter` → select `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`
3. Right-click `main.py` → `Debug 'main'` to set breakpoints and debug

</details>

### 6. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run a single test file
pytest tests/test_game_manager.py

# Verbose output
pytest -v
```

### 8. Build & Package

```bash
# Install build tool
pip install pyinstaller

# PyInstaller build (default, produces dist/ + Zip)
python build_exe.py

# Nuitka build (C++ compilation, stronger code protection)
python build_exe.py --nuitka

# Clean build artifacts only
python build_exe.py --clean

# Build without generating Zip
python build_exe.py --no-zip
```

Build output goes to `dist/`, and a `OpenSteamToolDesktop-{version}.zip` is generated in the project root.
